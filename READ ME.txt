 # Seek Job Scraper

## Overview
This project is a web scraper designed to collect job listings from **Seek** using Selenium. It extracts job details such as title, company name, location, classification, profession, salary, and posting date. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- Automates job search on Seek
- Filters results based on job classification and date range
- Extracts key job details such as title, company, salary, and location
- Saves scraped data in a structured CSV file
- Handles pagination to scrape multiple pages

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Google Chrome** (latest version)
- **ChromeDriver** (Managed automatically by `webdriver-manager`)
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install selenium pandas webdriver-manager
  ```

## How to Use
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd seek-job-scraper
   ```
2. **Run the Script**
   ```sh
   python seek_scraper.py
   ```
3. **Modify Search Parameters**
   - Edit the `search_bar.send_keys("General Practitioner")` line to change job search keywords.
   - Modify classification selection if needed.

4. **View the Results**
   - The scraped data is saved in `Scraped_data.csv`.
   - Open the CSV file in Excel, Google Sheets, or a Python DataFrame for further analysis.

## Code Structure
- `setup_driver()`: Initializes the Selenium WebDriver.
- `calculate_date_from_hours_ago(hours_ago)`: Converts relative time (e.g., '5h ago') to a standard date format.
- **Web Scraping Steps:**
  1. Navigate to Seek
  2. Input search keywords
  3. Select classification (optional)
  4. Filter by date
  5. Extract job details
  6. Handle pagination
  7. Save data to CSV

## Limitations
- **Website Structure Changes:** Seek may update its website, requiring XPath adjustments.
- **CAPTCHA & Bot Detection:** Running too many requests may trigger CAPTCHA or block access.
- **Pagination Limit:** The script is set to scrape up to 50 pages but can be adjusted.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **proxy rotation** and **headless browsing** for stealth.
- Improve **error handling** and logging.
- Add **database support** to store job data.
- Enhance search customization (e.g., location filters, salary range).

## Disclaimer
This scraper is intended for educational and research purposes only. Ensure compliance with Seek's terms of service before running the script.
